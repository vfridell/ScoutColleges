<h3>Notes</h3>
<h4>Belmont University</h4>
<p>Tuition Exchange deadline Dec 1. Need to have all application materials in.

<h4>Lawrence University</h4>
<p>She will most likely get tuition exchange based on my conversation with fin
aid during our visit. There is no real deadline.
Other Scholarships at Lawrence: For Conservatory of Music (B.Mus., B.M.A., or B.A./B.Mus Double Degree) candidates, audition scores are factored into overall merit scholarship consideration. Conservatory students are awarded holistic merit scholarships that consider both musical and academic accomplishments. Scholarships are renewable annually and range up to half tuition. Conservatory applicants are considered for scholarships as part of our review of their completed application for admission and audition. No additional steps are required. Students who receive a merit scholarship will learn about it at the time they receive their admission decision

<h4>University of Delaware</h4>
<p>Any freshman or transfer Tuition Exchange applicant must complete the UD application process and be officially admitted as a full-time undergraduate student. A TE online application must also be received by the Jan. 15 deadline for consideration. All freshman applicants will be notified of their award status by early March
<p>Students who audition to be accepted as music majors are considered for music scholarships during their auditions. These scholarships are competitive and are offered by recommendation after all auditions have been completed. All music majors who receive School of Music scholarships may be required to participate in more than one ensemble.
<p>Merit scholarships are offered at the point of admission, and the admission application is the only form required for consideration of merit scholarships. 

<h4>Ithaca College</h4>
<p> They just entered tuition exchange this year! The website is vague, but I sent
an email asking for more information. My guess is that Ithaca is like Bard.

<h4>Bard College</h4>
<p>If a student has been awarded a Bard need-based scholarship and is subsequently chosen to receive a Tuition Exchange Grant, these funds will replace all or a portion of the already awarded Bard scholarship. If the Tuition Exchange grant exceeds the originally awarded Bard scholarship, only a Tuition Exchange Grant will be awarded. Notification of acceptance into the Bard College Tuition Exchange program will be on or about March 31.
